This is an ecommerce home page created by me using everything I learned in the web development course I am taking. This project 
includes a lot of boostrap knowledge, some javascript, I created a server from scratch using Node JS and Express as a framework to handle
different requests as POST and GET.
Finally I used Heroku App, to deploy my website and to see it through the WWW, refer here (https://sidetoside2.herokuapp.com/) to go
to my website :)
