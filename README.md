This project has been created using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, some JS to design the frontend. 

The backend was created from scratch using Node JS and Express as a framework.

Finally I used Heroku App, to deploy my website and to see it through the WWW, refer here (https://sidetoside2.herokuapp.com/) to go
to my website :)
